            <h1>CSS Templates</h1>
            <p>I found that looking at and modifying existing CSS templates can teach you a great deal about styling and positioning elements of a website. As a basis for my website, I started from <a href="http://www.freecsstemplates.com/templates/css059.html" target="_blank">this template</a> and modified it to my needs.</p>
            <p>I removed the elements I did not need and adjusted others so they would fit my project. Positioning of elements and the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp" target="_blank">CSS box model</a> can be very tricky at times.</p>

        <div id="tool2" class="toolContent">
            <h1>HTML iFrames</h1>
            <img src="http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/hh563496.HowToSafeguardYourSiteWithHTML5Sandbox4(en-us,MSDN.10).png" class="toolImage w60">
            <p>I used <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp" target="_blank">iframes</a> to structure and separate my content. While navigating via iframes comes with the disadvantage of disabling the browsers own navigation (no more going back a page), they let me separate layout from content so I could keep a good overview on everything and they allowed me to apply a lot of interactivity with ease.</p>
            <p>The fact that the use of iframes is debatable and comes with controversial opinions can be read about <a href="http://www.ganshani.com/2007/12/debate-over-iframes-in-html/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3797179/why-do-people-still-use-iframes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h1>Method Draw</h1>
            <p>I used <a href="http://editor.method.ac/" target="_blank">Method Draw</a> to create the two icons in the navigation bar which enable changing the size of and swapping the assignment and code windows. You can create your image on a drawing surface and then export the result as an SVG file. It is also possible to import images and convert them to SVG.</p>
            <p><a href="http://css-tricks.com/using-svg/" target="_blank">SVGs</a> are extremely light-weight and provide great flexibility and interactivity since all elements of the image can be accessed individually. Hovering over my buttons for instance only causes the inner background of the image to turn orange.</p>

            <h1>Adobe Kuler</h1>
            <p><a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/" target="_blank">Adobe Kuler</a> proved to be an excellent tool to create and find good colour themes. You can either browse for colour themes created by other users by keyword or use the colour wheel to create your own.</p>
            <p>Choosing the right colours for my page was not an easy task at all and I learnt that even the slightest change in colour can make a huge difference in the end. Colour coding is a science in its own right...</p>

        <div id="tool5" class="toolContent">
            <img src="http://jmblog.github.io/color-themes-for-google-code-prettify/img/tomorrow-night-clipped.png" class="toolImage w50">
            <h1>Google Prettify</h1>
            <p>I formatted the code displayed on my pages with the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/" target="_blank">GooglePrettify</a> plug-in, using the <a href="http://jmblog.github.io/color-themes-for-google-code-prettify/" target="_blank">'Tomorrow Night'</a> template created by Chris Kempson.</p>
            <p>The tool knows a lot of programming languages, analyses them and does appropriate <a href="http://www.ehow.com/info_8764913_syntax-highlighting.html" target="_blank">syntax highlighting</a>. Very helpful indeed as otherwise my code could never have looked that pretty.</p>

        <div id="tool6" class="toolContent">
            <img src="http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2013/04/tooltipster.jpg" class="toolImage w60">
            <h1>ToolTipster</h1>
            <p>I wanted to display tooltips in my code that can be switched on and off and found <a href="http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/" target="_blank">ToolTipster</a>, which is an easy-to-use jQuery plug-in to create and style tooltips. I found it easy to set up and it comes with a good tutorial.</p>
            <p>Although I did style my tooltips, I stayed far below the possibilities it has to offer. It gives you the option to define animations, gives you great control over position and even lets you create interactive tooltips.</p>

        <div id="tool7" class="toolContent">
            <img src="http://howtodoinjava.com/wp-content/uploads/jquery_logo.png" class="toolImage">
            <h1>jQuery API</h1>
            <p>The <a href="http://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank">API documentation</a> for JQuery is extensive, well structured and comes with many excellent examples of the functions that jQuery has to offer.</p>
            <p>There were many times that I found solutions to my problems in the API documentation and did not have to search the web at all. For instance, I found the 'slideUp' method I used on <a href="https://gist.github.com/FKuhlewind/9950117" target="_blank">this page</a> (and by the way, the code for this page contains only 5 lines...)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="tool8" class="toolContent">
            <img src="http://www.skrenta.com/images/stackoverflow.jpg" class="toolImage">
            <h1>Stack Overflow</h1>
            <p>Speaking about searching the web: While looking for answers to my questions, I found that many of them had been asked already and about 98% of them had already been answered on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
            <p>This is a Q+A site specifically designed for programmers and its' community seems to be very skilled and helpful. I eventually turned to typing 'stackoverflow + myQuestion' into the <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> search field as it usually provided me with the best answers.</p>
        </div>
   
        <div id="tool9" class="toolContent">
            <img src="http://www.hakandemirel.com.tr/blog/wp-content/uploads/jsfiddle.png" class="toolImage">
            <h1>jsFiddle</h1>
            <p>Searching for answers, I soon came across <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/" target="_blank">jsFiddle</a>, which you can use to test little code snippets.</p>
            <p>Wanting to implement a new feature, I often started out with a fiddle created by someone else and changed it to my own needs before integrating it into my portfolio.  Before I came across jsFiddle, I had lost a lot of time already writing and pasting code into my project only to find out that it was not working because something was still missing...</p>

        <div id="tool10" class="toolContent">
            <img src="https://drupal.org/files/project-images/github_commits_logo_0.png" class="toolImage">
            <h1>GitHub</h1>
            <p>This page was built entirely on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, which I grew to appreciate. It allowed me to go back and compare to older versions of my files in case something went wrong and I often looked at other peoples repositories for inspiration.</p>
            <p>I even stopped using an external editor and coded in <a href="https://github.com/FKuhlewind/Portofolio1/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank">my repository</a> directly. My website is published using the <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> functionality which allowed me to make changes and see the outcome immediately.</p>
