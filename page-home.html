<h1>Art, Science and Technology - Portofolio #1</h1>

<p class="intro">Instead of writing about my assignments and what I have learnt completing them, I decided to put what I have learned into practice by creating a website.</p>

<p class="intro">My aim was to create an interactive website that speaks for itself and which can be explored at different depth levels. I hope that as visitor you will be able to follow my learning curve: by looking and trying out the assignments and through the option of exploring the code and looking at the files that were created in the process of bringing the pages to life.</p>

<p class="intro">I have encountered problems that I have not even dreamt of a few weeks ago and can fully consent with the remark that in coding, utter desperation and great joy are very close relatives. Interestingly enough, the self-referencing properties of this page turned out to be of increasing help with regards to finding solutions to new problems.</p>
