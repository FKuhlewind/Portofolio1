<h1>Art, Science and Technology - Portofolio #1</h1>

<p class="intro">Instead of writing about my assignments and what I have learnt completing them, I decided to put what I have learned into practice by creating this website.</p>

<p class="intro">In addition, I wanted to somehow include the theoretical texts that were discussed in the AST seminars add a bit more depth and background to the pure coding side of things.</p>

<p class="intro">My aim was to create an interactive website that speaks for itself and which can be explored at different depth levels. I hope that as a visitor you will be able to follow my learning curve: by looking and trying out the assignments and through the option of exploring the code and looking at the files that were created in the process of bringing the pages to life.</p>

<p class="intro">I have encountered problems that I have not even dreamt of a few weeks ago and can fully consent with the remark that in coding, utter desperation and great joy are very close relatives. Interestingly enough, the self-referencing properties of this page turned out to be of increasing help with regards to finding solutions to new problems.</p>

<p class="intro">Coming to an end with this portofolio was difficult, as along the way I came up with more and more ideas on how certain aspects can be improved further and how I could reduce code substantially with the new tools and methods I came across. When I created this page, I started about possibilities of putting the tools into practice by creating an application that can be of real use to someone, but I will store this thought in a little cupboard and get them out again by the time I need to start working on the final portofolio.</p>

<p class="intro">I hope you enjoy browsing through these pages,</p>
